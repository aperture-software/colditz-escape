_Colditz Escape_ is a rewritten game engine for the classic "Escape From Colditz" Amiga game.
In this game, you control a set of four prisoners of war trying to escape from the infamous Colditz Castle WWII prison.

The original game, created by _Mike Halsall_ and _John Law_ (with intro music by [Bj√∏rn Lynne](https://lynnemusic.com/)),
was published in 1991 by Digital Magic Software.
This new version, which allows you to play the game on Windows, Linux, macOS and PSP platforms, has been reverse engineered from the
original Amiga game engine and is released under a GPL v3 license.

For more information, see [the documentation](docs/index.md).
