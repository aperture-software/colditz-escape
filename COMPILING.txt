  Colditz Escape - Rewritten Engine for "Escape From Colditz"


WINDOWS (Visual Studio 2017):
=============================

If running Windows 8 or later, you shouldn't have to install anything special.

If not running Windows 8 or later, you will need to download and install the
latest DirectX SDK, which should be listed at:
  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812
This provides: 
- X2Audio libs: X3DAudio.lib (as well as xaudio2.h)
- DirectShow movie player lib: strmiids.lib

Make sure the relevant directories for DX and the Windows SDK are set in
Tools -> Options -> Projects and Solutions -> VC++ Directories

Optional 
- You can update the GLSL zoom shader(s), with the static version of the Glew
  library from: http://glew.sourceforge.net/

LINUX (gcc)
===========

Make sure you have gcc and the following packages installed:
  libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libxmu-dev libxi-dev libglew-dev libasound-dev
Then run:
  make release

OSX (Xcode)
===========

You should have XCode, XQuartz (which you can download from https://www.xquartz.org/)
and GLEW installed. For XBox 360 Controller support, you should also install the latest
360Controller package from https://github.com/360Controller/360Controller/releases.
Note that if needed, you can install GLEW by running the following:
  ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" < /dev/null 2> /dev/null
  brew install glew
Once you have the prerequisites, simply run:
  make release

PSP (PSP SDK):
==============

Use any recent version of the PSP SDK and run 'make release'
